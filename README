2D Simulation of Organic MIS Capacitors

project for the course: "Advanced Programming for Scientific Computing"

====================================
Build and execution of the program:
====================================

	What is needed:

1. folder 'src' with the source files

2. folder 'test' with the main of the tests

3. Makefile

4. latest version of libraries Bim++ and p4est must be installed.

N.B. everything must be placed in a root folder, (3) outside the 'src' or 'test' folders.


	How to build the code:

1. 'cd' to the directory containing the root folder where (1), (2), (3) are.

2. Type 'make' to compile.

N.B. Now a 'build' folder should have been created in the root folder.


	How to execute the code:
  
1. 'cd' to the 'build' directory.
  
2. type './name_of_test' to execute.


N.B. 1: output files will be created in the 'build' folder.

N.B. 2: results can be visualized in Octave by suitable Octave scripts provided in the 'test' folder.


- 'Vguess_vis.m' is for the visualization of the initial guess provided to NLPoisson problem;
prior to run it, output file 'Vguess_visualization' must be loaded in the Octave Workspace.

- 'Poisson_visual.m' is for the visualization of Laplace/Linear Poisson/Non-Linear Poisson problem results;
prior to run it, output file 'Laplace/LinPoisson/NLPoisson_output' must be loaded in the Octave Workspace.

- 'Poisson_3D_vis.m' is for a 3D visualization of the results at the previous point;
prior to run it, output files 'Vguess_visualization' and 'Laplace/LinPoisson/NLPoisson_output' must be loaded in the Octave Workspace.

- 'CV_visual.m' is for the visualization of the computed CV curve;
prior to run it, output file 'CVcurve_output' must be loaded in the Octave Workspace.
