2D Simulation of Organic Thin Film Transistors

project for the course: "Advanced Programming for Scientific Computing"

====================================
Build and execution of the program:
====================================

	What is needed:

1. folder 'src' with the source files

2. folder 'test' with the main of the tests

3. Makefile

4. file input: the data set named "input_data.csv"

5. libraries Bim++ and p4est must be installed.

N.B. everything must be placed in a root folder, (3) and (4) outside the 'src' or 'test' folders.


	How to build the code:

1. 'cd' to the directory containing the root folder where (1), (2), (3) and (4) are.

2. Type 'make' to compile.

N.B. Now a 'build' folder should have been created in the root folder.


	How to execute the code:
	
1. place the data set (4) in the new folder 'build'.
  
2. 'cd' to the 'build' directory.
  
3. type './name_of_test' to execute.

N.B. output files will be created in the 'build' folder.
