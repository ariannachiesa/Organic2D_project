2D Simulation of Organic Thin Film Transistors

project for the course: "Advanced Programming for Scientific Computing"

====================================
Build and execution of the program:
====================================

	What is needed:

1. folder 'src' with the source files

2. Makefile

3. file input: the data set named "input_data.csv"

4. libraries Bim++ and p4est must be installed.

N.B. everything must be placed in a root folder, (2) and (3) outside the 'src' folder.


	How to build the code:

1. 'cd' to the directory containing the root folder where (1), (2) and (3) are.

2. Type 'make' to compile.

N.B. Now a 'build' folder should have been created in the root folder.


	How to execute the code:
	
1. place the data set (3) in the new folder 'build'.
  
2. 'cd' to the 'build' directory.
  
3. type './mis_main2D' to execute.

N.B. output files will be created in the 'build' folder.
